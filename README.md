# exchangerApp

---When user first opens project his current currency is set by system based on his country code. 
---User can change his base currency to another currency symbol
---After user select, he is allowed to use convertor by entering amount and currency which he wants to convert to
---Exchange rates pages shows fresh rates  for selected base currency

With hard refresh redux store cleans user's base currency, so to test this  program properly , it would be better to use only client side routing. Because i didn't set it to local storage.
